# Advent of Homebrew

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions, as Nintendo Wii homebrew.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* devkitPPC toolchain, by [devkitPro](https://github.com/devkitpro). The toolchain is available on Linux, Windows, and macOS; see the [Getting Started](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started) page on the devkitPro wiki. The toolchain is also available as a [Docker image.](https://hub.docker.com/r/devkitpro/devkitppc)
* [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) template library for C++
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/) build system

### Build, package, and install

The default `make` command generated by CMake will produce a `boot.dol` executable. This can be run
on a homebrew-enabled Wii or on a Wii emulator such as [Dolphin](https://dolphin-emu.org/).

CMake also provides a `make zip` target that packages the application in a zip file. To install it
to a homebrew-enabled Wii, unzip the `advhb.zip` file inside the `/apps` directory in the root of a
FAT32-formatted SD card. Advent of Homebrew should then appear in the Homebrew Channel.

## Implementing AOC solutions

The `advhb::Solution` class facilitates implementation of solutions to daily AOC problems.
Declaring a `advhb::Solution` object registers the solution and makes it selectable in the runtime
menu. Examples of implemented solutions can be found in the source files in the `source/solutions`
directory.

Inputs for daily AOC problems are stored in the `input` or `input-test` directories at the
application root. The application uses the naming convention `YYYY-DD.txt` for input and test 
files. 

Test files for completed solutions are provided in `input-test`. Users are expected to add their
own puzzle inputs to the `input` directory as these will differ from user to user, unlike uniform
test inputs.

## Controls

are explained in the menu but are pretty basic: up/down on the D-pad to cycle through years or
days, 1 or 2 selects part 1 or part 2, A forward, B back, HOME returns to the system menu after a
solution finishes. The application also responds to the Power and Reset buttons on the console.
